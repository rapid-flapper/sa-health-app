# üöÄ Deployment Guide - PythonAnywhere

**Complete step-by-step instructions to deploy the SA Health App to PythonAnywhere**

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ GitHub account (you have: rapid-flapper)
- ‚úÖ Your code is on GitHub (yes: sa-health-app)
- ‚úÖ PythonAnywhere account (we'll create this)

---

## üéØ Step 1: Create PythonAnywhere Account

### **1.1 Sign Up**

1. Go to: https://www.pythonanywhere.com
2. Click **"Start running Python online in less than a minute!"**
3. Click **"Create a Beginner account"** (FREE)
4. Fill in:
   - **Username**: Choose something professional (e.g., `sahealthapp` or `arnolddev`)
   - **Email**: Your email
   - **Password**: Create a strong password
5. Click **"Register"**
6. Verify your email

**Your URL will be**: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.pythonanywhere.com`

For example, if you chose `sahealthapp`, your URL will be:
```
https://sahealthapp.pythonanywhere.com
```

---

## üîß Step 2: Set Up Your Web App

### **2.1 Open Bash Console**

1. Log in to PythonAnywhere
2. Click **"Dashboard"** (top menu)
3. Click **"Consoles"** tab
4. Click **"Bash"** to open a new console

### **2.2 Clone Your Repository**

In the Bash console, type these commands:

```bash
# Clone your GitHub repository
git clone https://github.com/rapid-flapper/sa-health-app.git

# Navigate into the project
cd sa-health-app

# Verify files are there
ls
```

You should see all your files: `app.py`, `data/`, `app/`, etc.

### **2.3 Create Virtual Environment**

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3.10 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Wait for installation to complete (~30 seconds).

### **2.4 Test That It Works**

```bash
# Quick test
python3.10 -c "from flask import Flask; print('Flask works!')"
python3.10 -c "from gtts import gTTS; print('gTTS works!')"
```

If both print "works!", you're good! ‚úÖ

project_home = '/home/YOUR-USERNAME/sa-health-app'
if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path = [project_home] + sys.path

# Set environment to production (not development)
os.environ['FLASK_ENV'] = 'production'

# Import Flask app
from app import app as application
```

**IMPORTANT**: Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual PythonAnywhere username!

5. Click **"Save"** (top right)

### **3.4 Configure Static Files**

## üöÄ After Deployment

### **Share Your App:**

**With Friends:**
```
Hey! Check out this medical translation app I built:
https://YOUR-USERNAME.pythonanywhere.com/app

It helps healthcare workers communicate across SA's 11 languages.
Would love your feedback!
```

**With Healthcare Workers:**
```
I've developed a tool to help with multilingual patient communication.
It's a prototype with 10 phrases in 5 languages.

Try it: https://YOUR-USERNAME.pythonanywhere.com/app

Your feedback on:
- Usefulness of current phrases
- Missing phrases you need
- Audio quality
- Overall user experience

Would be invaluable for development!
```

## üìà Next Steps After Feedback

Based on what you learn:

**Phase 2 Planning:**
1. Prioritize most-needed phrases
2. Expand to 50-100 phrases
3. Decide on audio strategy:
   - Record native speakers?
   - Use Azure TTS (better quality)?
   - Keep gTTS (good enough)?
4. Add requested features
5. Consider PWA for offline use
