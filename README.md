# SA Health App

## Project Overview

A multilingual medical communication app designed for frontline healthcare workers in South Africa. This app addresses the challenge of language barriers in healthcare settings by providing common medical phrases in multiple South African languages, complete with pronunciation guides and audio playback.

1. **Multilingual Medical Phrases**
   - Common healthcare phrases in multiple South African languages
   - Clear text display for each phrase

2. **Pronunciation Support**
   - Phonetic/pronunciation guides for correct pronunciation
   - Helps healthcare workers learn proper pronunciation

3. **Audio Playback**
   - Text-to-speech audio for each phrase
   - Allows healthcare workers to hear native pronunciation
   - Play button for instant audio playback

4. **Mobile-Optimized Interface**
   - Designed for use on mobile devices
   - Quick access in healthcare settings
   - Touch-friendly interface

## Language Support

### Phase 1 (Initial Launch)

- **Data Storage**: JSON file format for phrases (easy to edit and maintain)

### Frontend
- **Design**: Mobile-first responsive web design
- **Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Approach**: Progressive Web App (PWA)

### Development Environment
- **Virtual Environment**: `health-venv`
- **Python Version**: 3.14.0

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
**Goal**: Create a functional online web app with core features

**Features**:
- âœ… Flask backend setup
- âœ… Mobile-optimized responsive UI
- âœ… 5 initial languages (English, Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, Sepedi)
- âœ… Text display of medical phrases
- âœ… Phonetic pronunciation guides
- âœ… Audio playback using TTS
- âœ… JSON-based phrase management
- âœ… Basic category organization (greetings, symptoms, instructions, etc.)

**Requirements**:
- Online connectivity required
- Works on mobile browsers
- Desktop browser compatible

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
**Goal**: Add offline capability and advanced features

**Planned Features**:
- ðŸ”„ Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation
- ðŸ”„ Offline functionality (cached content)
- ðŸ”„ Installable on phone home screen
- ðŸ”„ Additional language support
- ðŸ”„ Expanded phrase library
- ðŸ”„ Basic keyword search functionality
- ðŸ”„ Favorites/bookmarks
- ðŸ”„ Usage tracking (optional)

### Phase 3: Intelligent Features (Future)
**Goal**: Add AI-powered phrase discovery and advanced intelligence

**Planned Features**:
- ðŸ”„ Large Language Model (LLM) integration
- ðŸ”„ Natural language query interface (e.g., "I need to ask about chest pain")
- ðŸ”„ Context-aware phrase suggestions
- ðŸ”„ Intelligent semantic search
- ðŸ”„ Smart recommendations based on situation description
- ðŸ”„ Privacy-conscious implementation (anonymized queries)

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Maintain category-based browsing as fallback
- Use as assistance tool, not for medical diagnosis
- Consider local open-source models for offline/privacy
- Build substantial phrase database first before LLM integration

## Design Decisions

### Why Flask?
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly
- Python-based (familiar for data scientists)
- Flexible and easy to extend
- Good documentation and community support

### Why JSON for Data Storage?
- Simple to edit manually
- No database complexity for MVP
- Easy to version control
- Sufficient for initial phrase volume
- Can migrate to database later if needed

### Why Text-to-Speech?
- No need for native speaker recordings initially
- Easy to generate audio automatically
- Scalable to multiple languages
- Can be upgraded to pre-recorded audio later

### Why Mobile-First?
- Healthcare workers are often on the move
- Mobile phones are ubiquitous in healthcare settings
- Quick access is critical in patient interactions
- PWA allows installation like a native app
